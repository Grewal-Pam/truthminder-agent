The Office of Price Administration (OPA) was established to control prices and allocate resources during wartime.\n\nThe quote \"rationing means a fair share for all\" suggests that the OPA aimed to ensure that everyone received a fair and equal portion of the available goods, such as food, gasoline, and other essential items, rather than allowing hoarding or profiteering. This was done to maintain social order and prevent shortages during times of scarcity.\n\nSo, in summary: During World War II, the Office of Price Administration (OPA) implemented rationing policies to ensure a fair share for all Americans by controlling prices and allocating resources."
