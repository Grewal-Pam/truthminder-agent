You can try searching online for artisans or craftspeople who specialize in creating replicas of historical items, such as cannons. Alternatively, you could check with local art schools, colleges, or universities that have programs in sculpture, woodworking, or metalworking to see if any students or professors might be interested in taking on a project like this.\n\nJust let me know if there's anything else I can help you with!"
